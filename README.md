# X User Notes - Why Did I Mute?

A simple browser extension for x.com (formerly Twitter) that helps you remember _why_ you muted or blocked a user and allows you to keep private notes on user profiles, visible only to you.

## Why use this extension?

Have you ever come across a profile on x.com and thought, "Why did I mute/block this person?" or wished you could jot down a private reminder about a user? This extension solves that problem.

## Features

- **Automatically logging mute/block events:** When you mute or block a user, the extension saves a link and the tweet you were viewing at the time, giving you context later.
- **Adding private notes fields:** A text area is added to user profile pages where you can write personal notes about that user.
- **Data Export/Import:** Easily back up your notes and logs or transfer them between browsers. Uses synced storage, so no need to move data between browsers if you are logged into your browser profile.

## Data Privacy

Your notes and mute/block logs are stored exclusively in your browser profile synced storage (`chrome.storage.sync`).

- Only you can see your notes.
- The data is synced between devices if you log in to the same browser profile
